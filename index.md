## About This Blog

Welcome! I'm on an 8-month journey to deeply understand AI and language models by building them from scratch. This blog documents my learning process, from basic neural networks to advanced transformer architectures.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Foundational Concepts**: Understanding neurons, activation functions, and neural network basics
- **Language Models**: From bigram models to GPT architectures
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Code walkthroughs and practical examples
- **Mathematical Intuition**: Breaking down complex concepts into digestible explanations
